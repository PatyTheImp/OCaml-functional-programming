# A-maze-ing mazes

This project is about mazes (labyrinths) where we want to find a way from an entrance to an exit. And if we can find the shortest path, that would be ideal.
There is the graphical representation of one maze on the right. It contains several rooms, represented by circles, and several oriented passages, represented by arrows. The blue rooms are the entrances and the green rooms the exits.
This maze does not contain loops. When dealing with maze with loops, the infinite paths become a concern.
This project is mostly about mazes with no loops. But also includes, at the end, a little taste of mazes with loops.
